# Fasta file format tips
With multi-fasta files, it is often required to extract few fasta sequences which contain the keyword/s of interest.
One fast way to do this, is by awk.

!!! note "data.fa"
    ```
    >Chr1
    ATCTGCTGCTCGGGCTGCTCTAT…
    >Chr2
    GTACGTCGTAGGACATGCATCG…
    >MT1
    TACGATCGATCAGCTCAGCATC…
    >MT2
    CGCCATGGATCAGCTACATGTA…
    ```

``` awk
$ awk 'BEGIN {RS=”>”} /Chr2/ {print “>”$0}' data.fa
```

Note that in the `#!awk BEGIN` section of the script, we have redefined the internal variable for the record separator `#!awk RS=”>”` which by default is "new line". This way, awk will treat the whole fasta (multi-line) record as one record. 

output:
```
>Chr2
GTACGTCGTAGGACATGCATCG…
```
